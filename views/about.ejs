						Hyperloop is a form of transportation that will revolutionize the way we move. It was first proposed by Elon Musk in a white paper published in 2013 
						<img id="to-mtl_train" class="float-right" src="images/HyperloopRoute.png"> 
						and will permit us to travel at unparalleled speeds, allowing global interconnectivity in a matter of minutes.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						The McMaster Hyperloop team is dedicated towards the innovation of the way we move.  
						Our proposed route is from Toronto to Montreal, and our goal is to reduce this travel time to a mere 39 minutes, travelling close to the speed of sound. 
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						The Hyperloop Pod Competition was started by SpaceX in 2015 to encourage a move towards sustainable transportation. The competing teams are required to create 
						a functional high-speed prototype of a hyperloop pod. The Hyperloop Pod Competition is now in its fourth installment, with only one judgement criteria, achieving 
						maximum speeds with successful deceleration.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">      
						We are proud to say that McMaster Hyperloop

						was one of the few teams to qualify in the very first Hyperloop Competition in 2015. We hope to carry on that legacy and build upon that tradition of excellence.
